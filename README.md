# Cosmos
A simulation of the universe (how galaxies are placed and where) in SFML and C++

The idea is to take the "rules of the universe" and apply it to this simulation, to generate an accurate example of what the universe looks like

Unfortunately, the universe is always expanding, and creating an accurate simulation of the placement of objects in the universe would be nearly impossible, so I have based my rules on general concencis online.

So even if this is not completely accurate, it still represents some part of the universe

> 1) Galaxies can be up to 13 light years away
>>   For my purposes, one pixel will be 1 light year


>Work in Progress!, will be adding algorithms to better represent the structure of galaxies in the universe
